# 📝 Command Line Todo-list App in Golang

## Overview
This is a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool implemented in Golang for managing tasks. The tool allows users to add tasks, list all tasks, edit task names, delete tasks, and mark tasks as completed.

## Features

- 🚀 **Web Application:** Transform the CLI tool into a full-fledged web application, enabling task management through a browser.
